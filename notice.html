    <h1>Notice regarding the future of the website</h1>
    <p>On August 2nd 2022, at 3:00 am UTC, the CBT 2 of Goddess of Victory: NIKKE released. </p><p>Being a private test, some users couldn't access the game, and tried to find a way to play. Within hours, the apk file of the game started being shared online allowing anyone with a code to play, even for users outside the country range allowed to play the game.</p><p>As a response to this issue, the development team of NIKKE wrote two warnings notices on social medias and in game warning users about their wrongdoings.</p><p>These warnings are aimed toward users datamining private content of the game and sharing it online, and inform that legal issues may occur for certain cases.</p><p>Nikke-DB is taking this threat seriously and will be reorganised to avoid issues.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The website will not show anything NEW from CBT 2 ( characters, skills)</li>
        <li>Every characters that are not in CBT 2 will be removed from the website</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Nikke-DB will now be what I always wanted it to be, a database of the game and not a leaking platform, while trying to stay on the legal side of Tencent/Proxima Beta/Level Infinite/Shift Up/whoever decided on taking legal actions.</p>
    <p>The website may also suddenly disappear one day, if the developers dislike it's existence and gently ( I hope ) ask me to delete everything.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your support from everywhere, in English, Korean and Japanese forums. I hope to run this website for as long as I can.</p><br><br>
